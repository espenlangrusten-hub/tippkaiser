/**
 * The admin's daily statistics email, sent at 18:00 Oslo time.
 *
 *   POST /report/daily        the scheduled send (.github/workflows/daily-report.yml)
 *   GET  /admin/report        the email as it would look now (requires x-admin-key)
 *   POST /admin/report/send   send it now, for testing (requires x-admin-key)
 *
 * /report/daily needs no key on purpose: GitHub would otherwise need a copy of ADMIN_KEY.
 * It is safe to leave open because it can do exactly one thing - send today's report to
 * the admin, once, and not before 18:00 - and it answers only whether it did. Today is
 * claimed in tippkaiser.settings before mail goes out, so the two scheduled runs (one
 * per daylight-saving offset) and anyone else calling cannot send twice. A failed send
 * releases the claim, so a later run can try again.
 *
 * Mail goes through Resend with the same secrets as the contact form (RESEND_API_KEY,
 * CONTACT_TO, CONTACT_FROM); the address is never in this public repository. SITE_URL,
 * if set, adds a link to the admin page.
