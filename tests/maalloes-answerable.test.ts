/**
 * Målløs charges 100 points - the maximum, and lower is better - for an answer it cannot
 * resolve. That makes one class of bug far worse than a crash: a question whose wording
 * promises a bigger answer set than the data can honour punishes the player for knowing
 * Norwegian football.
 *
 * It shipped once. "Navngi en spiller som har scoret for Norge" accepted 33 names, built
 * from a goal archive covering 98 of Norway's 574 goals, so four correct answers in five
 * cost the player 100 each. These tests hold the two rules that stop it returning.
